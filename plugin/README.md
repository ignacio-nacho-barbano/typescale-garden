# Figma docs ref

Below are the steps to get your plugin running. You can also find instructions at:

https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/

This plugin template uses Typescript and NPM, two standard tools in creating JavaScript applications.

First, download Node.js which comes with NPM. This will allow you to install TypeScript and other
libraries. You can find the download link here:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Next, install TypeScript using the command:

npm install -g typescript

Finally, in the directory of your plugin, get the latest type definitions for the plugin API by running:

npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings

If you are familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript will look very familiar. In fact, valid JavaScript code
is already valid Typescript code.

TypeScript adds type annotations to variables. This allows code editors such as Visual Studio Code
to provide information about the Figma API while you are writing code, as well as help catch bugs
you previously didn't notice.
